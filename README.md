# Sorting-visualizer

Abstract
 
         This project is to visualize the working of some sorting algorithms.It is developed using HTML,CSS,Java Script.
         It would be useful for beginners to learn algorithms by visualising their working.
         
Working

        Select the algorithm to visualise.
        
        Then specify the total number of elements for which the bar graph appears.
        
        Select sort option which would call the particular sorting algorithm in which the comparisons are made and sorting is performed.
        
        The final sorted bar graph will be displayed.
